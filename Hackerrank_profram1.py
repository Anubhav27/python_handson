This is an introductory challenge. The purpose of this challenge is to give you a working I/O template in your preferred language.
 It includes scanning 2 integers from STDIN, calling a function, returning a value, and printing it to STDOUT.

 Your task is to scan two numbers from STDIN, and print the sum A+B on STDOUT.

Note: The code has been saved in a template, which you can submit if you want.

Input Format
This section specifies the Input Format.
Given A and B on two different lines.

Output Format
This section specifies the Output Format.
An integer that denotes Sum u"(A + B)"

Constraints
This section tells what input you can expect. You can freely assume that the input will remain within the
boundaries specified. As an example here given below, A and B will never be below 1 or above 1000.
1 u"≤" A, B ≤ 1000"
